      <p>When I was a little kid, I loved watching movies. The first movie I saw was “Captain America: The First Avenger.” I was awestruck by his superpowers — the strength to fight evil and save others.</p>
      <p>But as I grew up, I realized something: you don’t need super serum to be a superhero. Every one of us fights quiet battles — waking up when it’s hard, pushing through fears, caring for others even when overwhelmed. Especially during the pandemic, I saw everyday people rise in extraordinary ways.</p>
      <p>Delivery workers, sanitation staff, journalists, doctors, nurses — risking their lives so others could live theirs. Even those with jobs, feeding strangers in need. Heroes weren’t in capes; they were in masks and uniforms. They were tired, overworked, underappreciated — but they kept going.</p>
      <p>We often forget: just showing up is heroic. If you’ve ever battled self-doubt or anxiety and still moved forward, you’ve earned that badge. So let’s be someone’s superhero today. Let’s recognize the invisible strength all around us.</p>
      <p><em>We’re all in this together — and sometimes, that’s all it takes to save a day.</em></p>
