      <p>Sometimes I wonder: what’s the purpose of life? Are we part of something larger — or are we just here by accident?</p>
      <p>Have you ever played <strong>The Sims</strong>? You build characters and control their every move. What if we’re like that — being watched or nudged from somewhere else? Maybe it's absurd. But it’s a question that keeps coming back.</p>
      <p>So much about life feels random. Where we’re born. The people we meet. The events that shape us. What if one detail had been different — a new school, another country? I often think about how my story would have unfolded if even one variable changed.</p>
      <p>There’s a saying: “Everything happens for a reason.” I used to believe that. But now I think maybe life is a blend — part coincidence, part consequence. We don’t choose everything, but what we do with what we’re given matters.</p>
      <p>It’s confusing. But maybe that’s okay. Like light, which is both a particle and a wave depending on how you look at it — life too might not fit neatly into one explanation.</p>
      <p><em>It’s messy, fascinating, and worth thinking about.</em></p>
